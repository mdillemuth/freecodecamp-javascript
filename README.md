# FreeCodeCamp - JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to the projects for [FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms &amp; Data Structures certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects). 

## JavaScript Projects

### Palindrome Checker

A program that checks if the given input is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

### Roman Numeral Converter

A program that converts the given number into an upper-case roman numeral.

### Caesars Cipher

A program that encrypts a string according to Caesar's cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher, meanings of the letters are shifted by a set amount. This function uses the ROT13 cipher. 

### Telephone Number Validator

A program that returns true if the passed string looks like a valid US telephone nubmer. 

### Cash Register
